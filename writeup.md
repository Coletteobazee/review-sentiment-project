## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

[The most common sentiment observed in this sample of reviews is Negative, with a frequency of approximately 27.]

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[The labels are generally reliable but not always perfect. In some cases, the model might misinterpret the review’s tone or context, like labeling a review as positive when it’s more neutral or vice versa. Hallucinations can distort the analysis by incorrectly categorizing reviews, leading to flawed conclusions. This can affect decision-making and risk misdirecting efforts to improve the product]

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[The most common sentiment in this sample is "Negative", which suggests there are key issues with the product or customer experience. I’d recommend the Coconut Water producer look into possible problems with quality, pricing, or overall customer satisfaction and make necessary adjustments. A closer look at the reviews would help pinpoint exactly what needs to change.]
